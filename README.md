Android ViewPagerIndicator - Xamarin Binding Library
==========================

Paging indicator widgets that are compatible with the `ViewPager` from the
[Android Support Library][2] to improve discoverability of content.

Try out the sample application [on the Android Market][10].

![ViewPagerIndicator Sample Screenshots][9]

These widgets can also be used in conjunction with [ActionBarSherlock][3]!


Usage
=====

*For a working implementation of this project see the `sample/` folder.*

  1. Include one of the widgets in your view. This should usually be placed
     adjacent to the `ViewPager` it represents.

        <com.viewpagerindicator.TitlePageIndicator
            android:id="@+id/titles"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent" />

  2. In your `onCreate` method (or `onCreateView` for a fragment), bind the
     indicator to the `ViewPager`.

         //Set the pager with an adapter
         ViewPager pager = (ViewPager)findViewById(R.id.pager);
         pager.setAdapter(new TestAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager()));

         //Bind the title indicator to the adapter
         TitlePageIndicator titleIndicator = (TitlePageIndicator)findViewById(R.id.titles);
         titleIndicator.setViewPager(pager);

  3. *(Optional)* If you use an `OnPageChangeListener` with your view pager
     you should set it in the indicator rather than on the pager directly.

         //continued from above
         titleIndicator.setOnPageChangeListener(mPageChangeListener);


Theming
-------

There are three ways to style the look of the indicators.

 1. **Theme XML**. An attribute for each type of indicator is provided in which
    you can specify a custom style.
 2. **Layout XML**. Through the use of a custom namespace you can include any
    desired styles.
 3. **Object methods**. Both styles have getters and setters for each style
    attribute which can be changed at any point.

Each indicator has a demo which creates the same look using each of these
methods.


Including In Your Project
-------------------------

    Install-Package Naxam.ViewPageIndicator.Droid

This project depends on the `ViewPager` class which is available in the
[Android Support Library][2] or [ActionBarSherlock][3]. Details for
including one of those libraries is available on their respecitve web sites.
